/**
 * 🦅 GARUDA AI — Kingdom Universe Theatre V3
 * Phase: Autonomous Investor Presentation + Live Universe Theatre
 *
 * Core Principle:
 * Structured taxonomy and execution bridges for GARUDA's 27 specialized domain execution universes.
 * Enforces Truth Law (VERIFIED !== PARTIAL !== PLANNED !== UNAVAILABLE).
 * Enforces Sovereign Capability Boundary Guard (strictly rejects out-of-boundary / unauthorized actions).
